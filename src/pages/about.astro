			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>
				Hi! I'm Edward. I'm a Full-stack software developer from
				Colombia with <span id="experienceTime">-</span> years of experience,
				specialized in creating robust solutions for the dealer after-sales
				sector. With a main focus on PHP for backend and frontend experience
				with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I combine skills in developing modules
				aimed at customer management and after-sales services, especially
				in CRMs/BPMs. I have designed and implemented customized solutions,
				such as a time control module for workshops and a spare parts quoting
				tool, optimizing key processes at dealerships.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to my experience in SQL and relational databases, I
				apply a continuous improvement approach to learning unit testing
				to ensure reliable code in personal projects. In parallel, my
				curiosity has led me to explore IoT technology and develop
				applications that integrate innovation and efficiency.
			</p>
			<h2>Technologies</h2>
			<p>
				There are some technologies that I have experience with, but I
				am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn
				and grow. Some of the technologies I have worked with or I'm
				currently learning are:
			</p>
			<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-3">
				{
					technologies.map((technology) => (
						<Image
							src={technology}
							alt="Technology logo"
							class="w-16 h-16 object-contain"
						/>
					))
				}
			</div>
		</section>
	</main>
	<script>
		const experienceTime = document.querySelector('#experienceTime');

		if (experienceTime) {
			experienceTime.textContent = (
				new Date().getFullYear() - 2021
			).toString();
		}
	</script>
